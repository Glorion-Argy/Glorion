# Welcome to Glorion
A versatile Apps Script project designed to enhance your Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) experience using Google Sheets. Glorion provides both Dungeon Masters (DMs) and players with powerful tools for customization and interaction, with the goal of supporting various TTRPG systems. As of right now, the tool supports **D&D 5e**.

If you're ready to jump in, visit the #getting-started channel for quick setup instructions.

> ***DISCLAIMER**: Much of the current artwork in Glorion is AI-generated due to budget constraints. However, the vision for Glorion is to reinvest 100% of its income into improvement, starting with funding artists to replace all AI-generated art. The transition to fully human-created art may take time, but it's a priority.*

# Key Features
## Mobile Functionality
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Glorion is fully optimized for mobile use within the Google Sheets app, allowing players and DMs to manage campaigns and characters easily from their phones or tablets. For mobile information, see #faq.

## Flexible Customization Options
- **Database Sheet Customization**: Customize your Database Sheet to add new game elements (classes, races etc.). No coding required, just fill in the cells as per the provided sheet structure to make changes to your campaign content.
- **Advanced Argument Customization**: For more detailed customization, use up to 50 arguments to refine abilities. Examples include `healing: true` or `attacks: 3`. These adjustments are made through the Apps Script editor (Extensions > Apps Script) but still require no coding skills. Detailed documentation for these customization options will be provided in the future.
- **Hooks and Custom Code**: For ultimate flexibility, Glorion supports 12 hooks and a `hookMemory` argument to embed custom code snippets throughout the ability process. While this requires some coding knowledge, example snippets will be available for ease of use. Comprehensive guides and examples will be provided to help with implementing custom code in a future update.

# Roadmap and Future Plans
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Glorion will be continuously maintained, with new features added to enrich functionality and user experience.
- **Community Contributions**: Expect an expanding library of classes, races, backgrounds, and other assets, some of them being Glorion Homebrew, while others being user-generated content. Certain community contributions will be featured after the blessing of their creator, along with full credits to them.
- **Documentation**: The entirety of the Glorion library, as well as the Google Sheet named (custom) functions will be documented thoroughly. For now, you can consult #faq or contact me directly for questions.
- **Professional Artwork**: All AI-generated artwork will be replaced by human-made art as funding allows.
- **Website and Dedicated Server**: Plans include developing a dedicated server and standalone website for Glorion, providing a project hub beyond Discord.
- **Multi-System Compatibility**: Although currently only supporting D&D 5e, Glorion is designed to expand compatibility with other TTRPG systems.
- **Original System Development**: With ongoing community support, the ultimate vision is for Glorion to evolve into its own TTRPG system, drawing inspiration from user feedback and other systems.
- **Standalone App**: With sufficient funding, Glorion may transition into a standalone app, broadening its potential beyond Google Sheets.

# About the Project
Glorion is named after the world I’ve been building for over a decade, embodying years of personal design and world-building efforts. As Glorion grows, I’ll share more insights into this world and the philosophy behind its design to inspire users to create their own unique content.

Happy adventuring, and may Glorion be a companion in all your epic quests!
