# How do I update the Glorion library to the latest version?

On any of your character's spreadsheets (based on **Glorion New Character**), click on **Extensions** in the top menu and select **Apps Script** from the dropdown. In the new tab that opens, look to the left under the **Files** section and find the **Libraries** section. Click on **Glorion** there, and a modal will pop up. In that modal, select the dropdown labeled **Version** and pick the latest version (it’ll be the highest number). Hit **Save**, close the modal, and you’re good to go! You can now close the **Apps Script** tab and get back to using your character sheet.
