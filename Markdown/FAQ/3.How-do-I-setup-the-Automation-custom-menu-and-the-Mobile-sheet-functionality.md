# How do I setup the Automation custom menu and the Mobile sheet functionality?

Both of these features are setup using **Triggers**. On any of your character's spreadsheets (based on **Glorion New Character**), click on **Extensions** in the top menu, then choose **Apps Script** from the dropdown. A new tab will open, and on the left, you'll see a vertical list of icons. Click on the fourth one, which looks like a clock, being labeled **Triggers** (you’ll see the name if you hover over it).

Once you're in the **Triggers** menu, click **Add Trigger** at the bottom left. In the modal that pops up, find the dropdown labeled **Choose which function to run** and select **customOnOpenTrigger**. Then, click the dropdown labeled **Select event type** and choose **On open**. This makes sure that whenever you open your spreadsheet, the **customOnOpenTrigger** function runs, refreshing your sheet and setting up the custom **Automation** menu. Hit **Save** to finish.

Now, repeat the process: click **Add Trigger** again, but this time select **customOnEditTrigger** in the **Choose which function to run** dropdown, and select **On edit** in the **Select event type** dropdown. Click **Save** again to wrap this up. This will handle the mobile functionality of your spreadsheet.

That’s it! You can close the **Apps Script** tab and continue using your character sheet.

We go to **Triggers**:

We add the **customOnOpenTrigger**:

And this is what your **Trigger** list should look like:
