# How can I add custom buttons for abilities?

In the **Database** spreadsheet, go to the **Buttons** sheet, where you’ll find three columns:
- The **Name** column is the label you give to your buttons. There are **28** default buttons, but you can add more names here, and they’ll automatically show up in the dropdown for the **Image** column in all **Action-Related** sheets.
- The **ID** column is the **Google Drive ID** of the image you’ve uploaded. Keep in mind, the image __MUST__ have at least **View Access** to be imported.
  - To find the **ID** of a file on **Google Drive**, right-click the file and select **Share**. In the sub-menu, click **Share** again, then under **General Access**, change the default **Restricted** setting to **Anyone with the link** (which gives it **View Access**). After that, click **Copy Link**. The link will look like `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JBNjJWRI-HCORqZGCqjZov22I9rxgvB9/view?usp=drive_link`,  and the **ID** is the part between `/d/` and `/view`, in this case, `1JBNjJWRI-HCORqZGCqjZov22I9rxgvB9`.
- The **Preview** column, shows what the image will look like, constrained to the size of the cell. If the preview doesn’t show right away, give it a few seconds. If it still doesn’t appear, double-check that the **ID** is correct and that the image has **View Access**. Don’t mess with this column, though, as it’s powered by an `ARRAYFORMULA`. Just let the *spreadsheet magic* handle this.

There’s no limit on the types of images you can add here. If you want more stylish buttons (I know, mine are pretty basic), you can upload **28** new images, one for each button, into a folder in **Google Drive**. Just make sure the whole folder has **View Access** to inherit it to all the images. Once that’s done, plug in each **ID** for each button, and voilà: you’ve got a brand-new set of custom buttons. Your imagination is the only limit here!

Lets say that we want to modify the **Use** button, into something more stylized:

![Button Use2](/Assets/Images/FAQ/4.How%20can%20I%20add%20custom%20buttons%20for%20abilities/1.button_use2.png)

At first, this is our **Buttons** sheet:

![Button List](/Assets/Images/FAQ/4.How%20can%20I%20add%20custom%20buttons%20for%20abilities/2.button-list.jpg)

We then upload that image on our drive:

![Share Button](/Assets/Images/FAQ/4.How%20can%20I%20add%20custom%20buttons%20for%20abilities/3.share-button.jpg)

And give it **View Access**:

![Button View Access](/Assets/Images/FAQ/4.How%20can%20I%20add%20custom%20buttons%20for%20abilities/4.button-view-access.jpg)

Finally, we extract the file ID and replace the old one of the **Use** button:

![Updated Button List](/Assets/Images/FAQ/4.How%20can%20I%20add%20custom%20buttons%20for%20abilities/5.updated-button-list.jpg)
