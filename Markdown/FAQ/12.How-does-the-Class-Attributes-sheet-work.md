# How does the Class Attributes sheet work?

The **Class Attributes** sheet of the **Database** spreadsheet manages custom fields for generating the **Attributes** sheet of your characters.
- The first columns define the criteria, like most sheets in the **Database** spreadsheet, where you set the conditions for when a custom field should be created.
- The **Cell** column specifies the exact cell where the custom field will be placed, such as the **Summons** field for the **Architect** class on **L3**.
- The **Fields** column is where you customize the field itself. The script will copy everything, content, styling, and even conditional formatting, and paste it into the specified cell when generating the **Attributes** sheet.

Think of the **Attributes** sheet as a half-finished puzzle, with the custom fields from the **Class Attributes** sheet being the puzzle pieces that complete it. Just be sure not to overlap these pieces, as that could lead to unintended results.

Lets say that we have a level 1 **Berserker**, their **Attributes** sheet being:

![Level 1 Berserker](/Assets/Images/FAQ/12.How%20does%20the%20Class%20Attributes%20sheet%20work/1.level-1-berserker.jpg)

On the **Class Attributes** sheet of the Database we can see that the **Berserker** gains the **Slots** (**Combat Slots**) field at level 2:

When we press **Level Up** on the character sheet, we'll find the message. You'll notice that we learn 2 **Bonus Action** abilities, and so we have to update both **Mobile** and **Bonus Actions** sheets. At the same time, we need to update our fields in the **Attributes** sheet, so that's included as well (the **Slots** field):

![Berserker Updates](/Assets/Images/FAQ/12.How%20does%20the%20Class%20Attributes%20sheet%20work/3.berserker-updates.jpg)

If we press **No**, we can always **Check for Updates** via the **Automation** menu:

![Check for Updates](/Assets/Images/FAQ/12.How%20does%20the%20Class%20Attributes%20sheet%20work/4.check-for-updates.jpg)

And we'll get this message, for our example:

![Pending Updates](/Assets/Images/FAQ/12.How%20does%20the%20Class%20Attributes%20sheet%20work/5.pending-updates.jpg)

After updating all necessary sheets, we can see that our level 2 **Berserker** now has the **Slots** field positioned in the **K1** cell of the **Attributes** sheet:

![Level 2 Berserker](/Assets/Images/FAQ/12.How%20does%20the%20Class%20Attributes%20sheet%20work/6.level-2-berserker.jpg)

We can also manually learn abilities through the **Learn Ability** button via the **Automation** menu:

![Learn Ability](/Assets/Images/FAQ/12.How%20does%20the%20Class%20Attributes%20sheet%20work/7.learn-ability.jpg)

Lets try to learn the custom **Thrill of the Kill** ability:

![Thrill of the Kill](/Assets/Images/FAQ/12.How%20does%20the%20Class%20Attributes%20sheet%20work/8.thrill-of-the-kill.jpg)

We'll be asked to update the **Passives** sheet, as this is a passive ability we're learning, the **Variables** sheet, as this requires 3 extra variables to function, and finally the **Attributes** sheet, as this includes a new field, which we can see on the **Class Attributes** sheet, under the **Choice** column:

![Thrill of the Kill Updates](/Assets/Images/FAQ/12.How%20does%20the%20Class%20Attributes%20sheet%20work/9.thrill-of-the-kill-updates.jpg)

And this is our **Berserker Attributes** sheet, with the **Bloodied** field added for **Thrill of the Kill**:
