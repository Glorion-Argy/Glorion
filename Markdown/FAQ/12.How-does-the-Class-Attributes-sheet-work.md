# How does the Class Attributes sheet work?

The **Class Attributes** sheet of the **Database** spreadsheet manages custom fields for generating the **Attributes** sheet of your characters.
- The first columns define the criteria, like most sheets in the **Database** spreadsheet, where you set the conditions for when a custom field should be created.
- The **Cell** column specifies the exact cell where the custom field will be placed, such as the **Summons** field for the **Architect** class on **L3**.
- The **Fields** column is where you customize the field itself. The script will copy everything, content, styling, and even conditional formatting, and paste it into the specified cell when generating the **Attributes** sheet.

Think of the **Attributes** sheet as a half-finished puzzle, with the custom fields from the **Class Attributes** sheet being the puzzle pieces that complete it. Just be sure not to overlap these pieces, as that could lead to unintended results.
