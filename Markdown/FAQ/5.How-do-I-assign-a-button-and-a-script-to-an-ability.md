# How do I assign a button and a script to an ability?

In the **Database** spreadsheet, go to any **Action-Related** sheet and find the row for the ability you want to modify (or create a new one by adding a row). Here's how to assign buttons and scripts:
- In the **Image** column, you can choose a button image for the selected ability. All options come from the first column of the **Buttons** sheet, and there's a dropdown to help you avoid mistakes. The default value is **Use**, so if you don’t pick a specific button, it’ll fall back to that.
- In the **Scale** column, set how large or small you want the button to appear compared to the original image. The default value is **0.7**, meaning the button will be scaled to **70%** of its original size. For example, a scale of **0.5** (or 50%) will shrink the button to half its size, while a scale of **2** (or 200%) will double it. A scale of **1** keeps it at its original size, and leaving this blank will default to **0.7**.
- In the **Width** column, you choose the width of the buttons column in the character's spreadsheet, which defaults to **50** pixels. The actual column width will be determined by the widest button in that column. For example, if you have five buttons, and their widths are 40, 75, and three defaults (at 50), the column will adjust to **75** pixels, the widest value.
- In the **Script** column, you’ll input the name of the function that gets triggered when the button is pressed. If you leave this blank, no button will be created, and the **Image**, **Scale**, and **Width** columns will be ignored. If a value is provided, the script will have "**Use**" affixed to the beginning. So, if you type **Dash**, the button will call the **UseDash** function.

Lets say that we want to modify the buttons of the **Berserker's Rupture** (Action) ability:

The ability has 2 buttons, one uses the default option of **Use** and the other uses **Tick**. We modify these to use the **Roll** and **Trigger** buttons instead, making the **Roll** button larger and assigning a minimum column width to the buttons column of **60**.

Now, we visit our **Berserker** character sheet and update the Actions sheet:

We wait for it to finish and eventually see the result of our modifications:
