# How do the Class, Race and Background Data sheets work?

These sheets store all the character creation info (basically level 1 abilities) for each class, race, and background. The pop-up modals during character creation, asking for input as you build a character, pull all their data from these sheets. Here’s a breakdown of what some of the columns do:

### Abilities
This column determines if there should be a choice node for a class, race, or background, shown by `Ability1 or Ability2` (with "** or **" acting as a delimiter). If you want certain abilities to be learned by default, just add them directly to the relevant **Action-Related** sheet. This column is only for cases where a choice between abilities is required.
- For example, the **Architect** has to choose between two abilities at level 1, indicated by:
```
Spectral Servant or Temporal Anomaly
```

### Skills
This column lists the skills your character would be proficient with. `Choose` means "*pick one from any available skill*", commas ` , ` work as the word "*and*", separating multiple skills, and ` or ` indicates a choice node.
- For example, `Choose, Arcana, Insight or Perception` means the character is proficient in **Arcana**, and must choose between **Insight** or **Perception** for the first choice node, with another choice node being your pick of any other skill proficiency.

### Languages
This column lists all the languages your character is proficient with, following the same guidelines as above.
- For example, the **Urselan** race must choose a **Standard** and an **Exotic** (or another **Standard**) language, as well as **Urseli**, indicated by:
```
Standard, Exotic, Urseli
```
You can also specify quantities. For example, `2 Standard` means two standard languages. By default, everything assumes `1`, so for the above example, you could also write:
```
1 Standard, 1 Exotic, Urseli
```
for the same result.

### Descriptions
This column provides the information shown to players during character creation, giving them some context about their choices. Keep these short to avoid overwhelming players with too much text.

All you need to do is write everything like you usually would in everyday language, and as long as you follow the rules, the script will take care of the rest. Once you get the hang of these guidelines, you’ll easily figure out the remaining columns. Lastly, the script automatically pulls the list of all classes, races, and backgrounds from the names in the first column of the **Class**, **Race**, and **Background Data** sheets, so you don’t need to add them manually to the **Lists** sheet (e.g., Classes: Alchemist, Architect, Berserker, Connoisseur, Nomad, Pathfinder). The script handles that part too.

Lets say that we want to create the grounds for a new class (**Shaman**), race (**Naga**) and background (**Trawlerman**). We'll begin building the **Shaman** class, by adding information to the **Class Data** sheet:

![Shaman](/Assets/Images/FAQ/9.How%20do%20the%20Class%2C%20Race%20and%20Background%20Data%20sheets%20work/1.shaman.jpg)

Then we'll build the **Naga** race, by adding information to the **Race Data** sheet:

![Naga](/Assets/Images/FAQ/9.How%20do%20the%20Class%2C%20Race%20and%20Background%20Data%20sheets%20work/2.naga.jpg)

And finally, the **Trawlerman** background, a variant of the **Artisan**, through the **Background Data** sheet:

![Trawlerman](/Assets/Images/FAQ/9.How%20do%20the%20Class%2C%20Race%20and%20Background%20Data%20sheets%20work/3.trawlerman.jpg)

Now, lets create our **Naga Shaman Trawlerman** character via the **Character Spreadsheet**. First, we select the class:

Then we select the race:

And in the end, we select the background, a variant of the **Artisan**:

You'll notice that all further choice nodes are based on the class, race, and background selections that we did, based on the information we added to the Database:
