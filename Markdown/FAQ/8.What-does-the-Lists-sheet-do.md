# What does the Lists sheet do?

The **Lists** sheet allows you to create tags for predefined groups of entities, for example:
```
Exotic Languages: Aphotic, Cryptic, Elysian, Protean, Scalesong, Stygian, Sylphic
```
```
Merchant's Pack (38gp): 10x Flask of Oil, 5x Paper Sheet, 5x Rations, 5x Sealing Wax, Abacus, Backpack, Chest, Lamp, Lock, Mess Kit, Scale, Scroll Case, Small Brush, Steel Mirror, Vial of Perfume, Waterskin
```
In the **Name** column, you assign a tag, and in the **List** column, you define the actual array of items or entities. You can then use these list tags across the **Level Up**, **Class**, **Race**, and **Background Data** sheets, and Glorion will know what you're referring to. For example:
- When classes reach level 4, they get two points to spend, increasing their attributes. This is indicated by `2 Attributes` in the **Attributes** column of the **Level Up** sheet, without needing to write:
```
Strength or Dexterity or Constitution or Intelligence or Wisdom or Charisma
```
- The **Artisan** background lets your character pick two artisan's tools during character creation. This is indicated by `2 Artisan's Tool` in the **Tools** column of the **Background Data** sheet. Be sure not to use plural forms like we usually would in everyday language. This template follows the format `{number} {name}`, and the name needs to match exactly with the tag in the **Lists** sheet. So, for instance, `2 Artisan's Tools` would not work as expectedâ€”it's got to be `2 Artisan's Tool`.
