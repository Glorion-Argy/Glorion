# What does the Lists sheet do?

The **Lists** sheet allows you to create tags for predefined groups of entities, for example:
```
Exotic Languages: Aphotic, Cryptic, Elysian, Protean, Scalesong, Stygian, Sylphic
```
```
Merchant's Pack (38gp): 10x Flask of Oil, 5x Paper Sheet, 5x Rations, 5x Sealing Wax, Abacus, Backpack, Chest, Lamp, Lock, Mess Kit, Scale, Scroll Case, Small Brush, Steel Mirror, Vial of Perfume, Waterskin
```
In the **Name** column, you assign a tag, and in the **List** column, you define the actual array of items or entities. You can then use these list tags across the **Level Up**, **Class**, **Race**, and **Background Data** sheets, and Glorion will know what you're referring to. For example:
- When classes reach level 4, they get two points to spend, increasing their attributes. This is indicated by `2 Attributes` in the **Attributes** column of the **Level Up** sheet, without needing to write:
```
Strength or Dexterity or Constitution or Intelligence or Wisdom or Charisma
```
- The **Artisan** background lets your character pick two artisan's tools during character creation. This is indicated by `2 Artisan's Tool` in the **Tools** column of the **Background Data** sheet. Be sure not to use plural forms like we usually would in everyday language. This template follows the format `{number} {name}`, and the name needs to match exactly with the tag in the **Lists** sheet. So, for instance, `2 Artisan's Tools` would not work as expected—it's got to be `2 Artisan's Tool`.

Lets say that we want to create an **Equipment Pack** of our own, the **Nobility Pack**, that we want to have as an extra option for our **Connoisseurs**, to begin with. We start by adding it as an extra class option in the **Class Data** sheet of the Database:

![Nobility Pack](/Assets/Images/FAQ/8.What%20does%20the%20Lists%20sheet%20do/1.nobility-pack.jpg)

We then go to the **Lists** sheet and create a new row, where we include all the information of what the **Nobility Pack** has:

![Lists](/Assets/Images/FAQ/8.What%20does%20the%20Lists%20sheet%20do/2.lists.jpg)

Finally, when during the character creation process, the last step is always to select an **Equipment Pack**. Having selected the **Connoisseur** first, we can see that we have 4 options now, instead of 3, the last one being the **Nobility Pack** we just created:

![Select Equipment Pack](/Assets/Images/FAQ/8.What%20does%20the%20Lists%20sheet%20do/3.select-equipment-pack.jpg)

After finishing the character creation process and having our **Character** sheet ready, this is a portion of our **Inventory**, consisting of items based on the following choices we made:
- **Class**: *Connoisseur*
- **Race**: *Wey Elf*
- **Background**: *Bastard*
- **Equipment Pack**: *Nobility Pack*
As you can see, all of the items from the **Nobility Pack** are here—the consumables are in another category and cannot fit in a single image (Parchment Sheet and Sealing Wax):
