# Why are there class abilities that aren't listed in the class sheets?

Certain abilities have been created as experimental rewards for players outside of the core class skill trees. These abilities, mostly passive, are granted by the **DM** when appropriate, and are not initially part of the class design. They are intended to add variety, serving as a breeding ground for fresh ideas that might at some point become baseline, if popular.
- For example, the **Connoisseur's Viscosity** ability started as a reward but later became a baseline ability, due to positive feedback.

To learn such abilities, players can click the **Learn Ability** button in the **Automation** custom menu at the top and input the ability's name.

Such abilities won't be included in the initial version of the project, with 2 exceptions, which are fully functional.
- **Thrill of the Kill**: For **Berserkers**, this ability adds extra damage when attacking **Bloodied** targets. The damage scales with weapon type and character level. Once learned, a checkbox for attacking **Bloodied** foes appears in the character's **Attributes** sheet, alongside three custom variables for damage calculation.
- **Predatory Instinct**: For **Pathfinders**, this ability grants a free turn at the start of combat, as long as the character isn't surprised. This ability rewards quick skirmishes, instead of long-drawn battles, feeding the class fantasy of the **Pathfinder**, while not requiring any variables.
