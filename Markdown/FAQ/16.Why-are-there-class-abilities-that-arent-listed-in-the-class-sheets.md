# Why are there class abilities that aren't listed in the class sheets?

Certain abilities have been created as experimental rewards for players outside of the core class skill trees. These abilities, mostly passive, are granted by the **DM** when appropriate, and are not initially part of the class design. They are intended to add variety, serving as a breeding ground for fresh ideas that might at some point become baseline, if popular.
- For example, the **Connoisseur's Viscosity** ability started as a reward but later became a baseline ability, due to positive feedback.

To learn such abilities, players can click the **Learn Ability** button in the **Automation** custom menu at the top and input the ability's name.

Such abilities won't be included in the initial version of the project, with 2 exceptions, which are fully functional.
- **Thrill of the Kill**: For **Berserkers**, this ability adds extra damage when attacking **Bloodied** targets. The damage scales with weapon type and character level. Once learned, a checkbox for attacking **Bloodied** foes appears in the character's **Attributes** sheet, alongside three custom variables for damage calculation.
- **Predatory Instinct**: For **Pathfinders**, this ability grants a free turn at the start of combat, as long as the character isn't surprised. This ability rewards quick skirmishes, instead of long-drawn battles, feeding the class fantasy of the **Pathfinder**, while not requiring any variables.

Lets say that we are a **Pathfinder** and want to learn the **Predatory Instinct** ability:

![D](/Assets/Images/FAQ/16.Why%20are%20there%20class%20abilities%20that%20aren't%20listed%20in%20the%20class%20sheets/1.learn-ability.jpg)

We write down the name of the ability and press OK:
> ***Note**: Searching for ability names has no case sensitivity, meaning that all of the following will work:*
> - *Predatory Instinct*
> - *predatory instinct*
> - *pREdaTorY inStiNCt*

![Perdatory Instinct](/Assets/Images/FAQ/16.Why%20are%20there%20class%20abilities%20that%20aren't%20listed%20in%20the%20class%20sheets/2.predatory-instinct.jpg)

If the ability exists and we meet all criteria of learning it, we get the following message, detailing which sheets will need updating, in order to actually learn such an ability:

![Update Sheets](/Assets/Images/FAQ/16.Why%20are%20there%20class%20abilities%20that%20aren't%20listed%20in%20the%20class%20sheets/3.update-sheets.jpg)

If the ability does not exist, we get a different message instead:

![Ability does not Exist](/Assets/Images/FAQ/16.Why%20are%20there%20class%20abilities%20that%20aren't%20listed%20in%20the%20class%20sheets/4.ability-does-not-exist.jpg)

If you know the ability already, we get a third message:

![Already Know Ability](/Assets/Images/FAQ/16.Why%20are%20there%20class%20abilities%20that%20aren't%20listed%20in%20the%20class%20sheets/5.already-know-ability.jpg)

Now, if we press **No** to the "*Update sheets*" statement, we can at some point in the future select **Check for Updates** from the **Automation** menu:

![Check for Updates](/Assets/Images/FAQ/16.Why%20are%20there%20class%20abilities%20that%20aren't%20listed%20in%20the%20class%20sheets/6.check-for-updates.jpg)

If we do so, we get the exact same choice again, in our case updating the **Passives** sheet, which adds the **Predatory Instinct** ability on our character:

![Pending Updates](/Assets/Images/FAQ/16.Why%20are%20there%20class%20abilities%20that%20aren't%20listed%20in%20the%20class%20sheets/7.pending-updates.jpg)

We can always manually update the **Passives** sheet as well, removing it from the list of pending changes:

![Update Passives Sheet](/Assets/Images/FAQ/16.Why%20are%20there%20class%20abilities%20that%20aren't%20listed%20in%20the%20class%20sheets/8.update-passives-sheet.jpg)

In our case, we had a level 1 **Goblin Pathfinder Outlaw** and this is the **Passives** sheet after learning the **Predatory Instinct** experimental ability:

![Passives Sheet](/Assets/Images/FAQ/16.Why%20are%20there%20class%20abilities%20that%20aren't%20listed%20in%20the%20class%20sheets/9.passives-sheet.jpg)
