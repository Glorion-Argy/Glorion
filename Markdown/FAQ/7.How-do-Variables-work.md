# How do Variables work?

In Glorion, variables are essentially **Named Ranges** in **Google Sheets**.
- A **Named Range** is just a label you assign to a specific range of cells (could be a single cell, a row, a column, or a bunch of cells). This label lets you reference that range more easily in formulas. For example, when calculating your character's max health, we use a formula that relies on three named ranges:
```
=CEILING(Base_Max_Health * Max_Health_Multiplier + Max_Health_Modifier)
```
- To see all the variables (named ranges) in your sheet, click on **Data** in the top menu and select **Named Ranges**. A list will pop up on the right side showing all the named ranges, with each label pointing to a specific range. Clicking on any of these named ranges will show you where it's located, and you can edit them by clicking the pencil icon. However, it’s best not to mess with these since they’re exclusively managed by scripts. You can also add your own named ranges by clicking **Add Range** at the top of the menu, then filling in a name and a range.

Now that you understand named ranges, let's talk about the variables of Glorion. When you create a character, the first sheet to be initialized is the **Variables** sheet, which we hide right after. To view it, click on **View** at the top menu, hover over **Hidden Sheets**, and select **Variables** from the list (probably your only hidden sheet). When you open it, you'll see two columns: one for the variable names and the other for their values. Every row in this sheet represents a variable, and each one is a named range. The name of the variable is the label of the range, and the value is stored in the corresponding cell in the second column. While you can modify these rows, it’s generally best to let the scripts handle them. Once you're done looking, you can re-hide the sheet by right-clicking on its tab and selecting **Hide Sheet**.

For **DMs**, the **Database** spreadsheet offers two sheets to manage variables:
- **Base Variables**: The **Variables** column is the variable’s label, and the **Calculation** column is its value, similar to the **Variables** sheet in character spreadsheets. The **Keep Value** column has a checkbox that controls whether the variable holds on its value when the **Variables** sheet is updated. If checked, the variable is initialized only once, and after that, it will keep its current value, ignoring any updates from the **Database**.
- **Class Variables**: These are class-specific variables, and they can either be unique or overwrite those in **Base Variables**. The first columns act as criteria, and variables with a **Tag** of **Extra** will only be loaded if the corresponding ability has been learned, based on the **Choice** column. The rest of the columns are similar to those in **Base Variables**.

Glorion provides two ways to interact with variables, both accessed via the **Automation** custom menu at the top of your sheet:
- **Update/Generate Variables Sheet**: This option will delete your current **Variables** sheet and recreate it from scratch. Don't worry, some key information is saved and restored afterward. You can even watch the process in action by opening the **Named Ranges** menu (**Data** > **Named Ranges**) and you’ll see the variables being generated in real-time. This entire process should start making a little more sense at this point.
- **Generate Variables**: This option won’t delete or wipe your current variables. Instead, it scans your entire spreadsheet for any missing variables and fixes any potential issues. This method is also how you create custom variables: just add new rows to the **Variables** sheet, give them unique names and values, and Glorion will create those variables as named ranges for you.

> ***DISCLAIMER**: If you update your **Variables** sheet, all __custom__ variables will be lost. To preserve them, you’ll need to make changes in the **Database** spreadsheet, so be sure to contact your **DM**.*

You can check all **Named Ranges** here:

You should see a list like the following:

![Named Range List](/Assets/Images/FAQ/7.How%20do%20Variables%20work/2.named-range-list.jpg)

Lets say that you want to "tag" the entire **Descriptions** columns of the **Actions** sheet as a **Named Range**. This is how it's going to look like, after clicking on **Add a range** and filling out the necessary information:

![Action Descriptions](/Assets/Images/FAQ/7.How%20do%20Variables%20work/3.action-descriptions.jpg)

Now, lets check the **Variables** sheet:

![Show Variables](/Assets/Images/FAQ/7.How%20do%20Variables%20work/4.show-variables.jpg)

It should look something close to this, the first column being the names, while the second one being their values:

![Variables](/Assets/Images/FAQ/7.How%20do%20Variables%20work/5.variables.jpg)

You can hide the sheet like this:

![Hide Variables](/Assets/Images/FAQ/7.How%20do%20Variables%20work/6.hide-variables.jpg)

On the Database the DM can edit any variable in the **Base Variables** sheet. Here you can see their names (**Variable** column), values (**Calculation** column) and whether they will keep their current value after updating or not (**Keep Value** column). For example, your **Database_ID** and **Items_Key** will always hold onto their initial value given during character creation, never replacing it (you'll notice that their default value is the empty string `""`—an empty cell, which will never replace your current values, unless you uncheck their checkbox).

Similarly, on the **Class Variables** sheet we also have some extra columns for criteria to conditionally load certain variables. For example, **Rejuvenating Salve** is an ability the **Thaumaturge** path of the **Alchemist** learns at level 3, which also loads a variable.

Finally, here's how you issue the **Update Variables Sheet** and **Generate Variables** commands:
