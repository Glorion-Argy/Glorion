# What do the Choice and Tag columns do in Action-Related sheets?

Abilities without a checkmark in the **Choice** column are automatically learned once you meet all the other conditions (**Class**, **Race**, **Level**, **Background**, and **Path**). If an ability has a checkmark in the **Choice** column, it's considered a choice node and it won’t be learned by default (e.g., while leveling up). You’ll need to select it yourself to learn it.

The **Tags** column is useful for grouping abilities, giving them a tag  that can be used in either the **Level Up** sheet, or in any script of yours. For instance, the **Alchemist** gains a **Cask** spell generally every couple of levels, so any choice node ability tagged as **Cask** will show up in the list of options, when the other criteria are met. Choice nodes can also be learned manually by using the **Learn Ability** button in the **Automation** custom menu at the top, though you won’t see a full list of spells. You’ll need to know exactly which ability you’re looking for, so consult your **DM**.

One extra note: item abilities (marked as **Item** in the **Path** column) cannot be choice nodes, so checking the **Choice** box doesn’t do anything for them. For these, the **Tags** column links the ability to a different item name. Most items and their abilities share the same name, but some don’t. For example, the **Bag of Ball Bearings** has an ability called **Ball Bearings** to keep things simple. You can show this in the **Database** spreadsheet by adding the **Tag** of **Bag of Ball Bearings** to the **Ball Bearings** ability.

Lets say that we want to create a new **Vial** ability for our level 7 **Alchemist**, as a new option to learn when they level up. We begin by creating the ability, which we'll call **Celestial Remedy**, a **Vial** used as a **Bonus Action**. We want to have a checkmark on the **Choice** column and a value of **Vial** on the **Tag** column:

We also add **Celestial Remedy** to the **Descriptions** sheet, giving it a brief explanation of what it does:

We then go and click on **Level Up** in our **Alchemist's** character sheet. At level 8, they gain 2 ability scores. We select one and repeat this once more for the second gain:

At level 8 an **Alchemist** also gains a new **Vial** ability. We can see that **Celestial Remedy** is now an option that we can select:
