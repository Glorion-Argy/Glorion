# Custom Button Image Limitations
As of right now, the only way to use custom images for your buttons, via the **Buttons** sheet of the **Database** spreadsheet, is by uploading an image in your drive, giving view access to it and passing its ID in the appropriate column. My plan for the future is to do some research of alternative ways of importing custom button images, such as using CDNs or any other cloud / image storing services.
