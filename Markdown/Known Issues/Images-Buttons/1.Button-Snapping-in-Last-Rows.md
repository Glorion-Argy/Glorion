# Button Snapping in Last Rows
There's a strange behavior when trying to move buttons from the final rows of a sheet (usually the very last one). The moment you move it a single pixel, it will snap above an "invisible barrier" that you can no longer move through. I have no idea what's causing this interaction, but it has to do with the way Google Sheets handle their images. What I can suggest is that you manually add a few rows below the final row of the sheet (you probably need only 1), moving that "barrier" below the row you want to have "access to". You then move the button to the appropriate place, only to remove created rows thereafter. I know it's gimmicky, but I'm a bit clueless about this issue.
