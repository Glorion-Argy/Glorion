# Persistent "@..." Message in Cell A1
Whenever you create or update a sheet, the first cell (A1) will always display the **Type "@..."** message by default. While updating a sheet through the Automation commands, if you switch to a different sheet before any cell takes a value, this message can become "stuck" in the cell. In such cases, any attempt to overwrite the message may not take effect, and it remains visible. This issue is purely visual and stems from a recent update in Google Sheets and the data entered is still processed correctly in the background. My suggestion is that you wait a few seconds for the data to populate within the cells of a sheet that you update, before switching sheets. Alternatively, refreshing the page will clear the visual error.
