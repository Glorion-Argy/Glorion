# Unexpected Borders in Merged Cells
There's a rare occasion of certain merged ranges of yours to have vertical borders inside of them, which they should not, as the cells inside them are merged into a single range. I cannot reliably replicate this issue, but it occurs once in a while, purely on the **Attributes** sheet. This is probably caused by an edge case in Google's codebase, when merging cells through scripting, but without reliability in producing the issue, I cannot be certain. Should you encounter this, worry not as it's purely visual and refreshing the page will clear it.
