# Data Loss Updating Action Sheets
Updating your action-related sheets (**Actions**, **Bonus Actions**, **Reactions**, **Interactions**, **Movement**, and **Passives**) will reset your current spell slots of all spells (e.g., if you have 1/3 slots remaining for your **Crimson Cone** ability, it will revert to the maximum of 3). This is a known issue from my end that I need to resolve and has nothing to do with Google. I'll get to it in the future and remove it from this list, as soon as it's resolved. For now, what I suggest is that you either keep track of your current spell slots before updating such a sheet, or do it after a **Long Rest**, making sure that no information is lost.
