# Data Loss Updating Character Sheets
When updating your **Character** sheet, all cell data remains intact, except for the character's image and any specific text formatting (e.g., certain **bold**, *italic*, __underscore__, or colored words), particularly in the description section, being the most probable place to have such formatting. This occurs because Google Apps Script cannot store image data (e.g. BLOB data) within a cell, as of right now, preventing it from being reproduced during updates. Additionally, Apps Script only preserves formatting at the cell or range level, not for individual characters and as a result, any customized formatting within a cell is lost. My suggestion would be to only update the **Character** sheet when necessary, such as when the **DM** modifies its template in the **Database** spreadsheet. If an update is required, copy any specially formatted text to another sheet and reapply it after updating. You'll also need to manually reinsert the character's image, unfortunately, until this gets resolved from Google's end.
