# Item Database Formatting
You may notice that certain words in the **Characteristics** column of the item database (**The Vault** and **The Archive** sheets in the **Database** spreadsheet) are formatted in **bold**. While this formatting effectively highlights important mechanical information about each item, it cannot be replicated in the **Inventory** sheet of any **Character's** spreadsheet. This limitation arises from my use of the `VLOOKUP` formula, which returns only values without any formatting. This allows for the convenient functionality of modifying item names and instantly retrieving associated information without the need for scripts. Additionally, you cannot manually change the formatting of specific words in any of the columns using this formula, as it would be considered *overwriting your data*, thereby disrupting its functionality. One potential solution would be to approach this as we did with the action-related sheets, fetching descriptions from the database individually via scripts and applying the custom `BOLD` formula to highlight key terms. However, this would compromise the "snappy" performance of the sheet, so I opted to maintain the current setup. Should I discover a better way to address this issue (or if `VLOOKUP` or a similar formula ever allows us to retrieve not only data, but formulas too), I will revisit this problem. For now, I'm retaining all highlights in the item database to assist **DMs**, as they browse through a multitude of items, and to preserve the formatting in case this issue gets resolved in a future update.
