# Row and Column Size Calculations
This is the big one... Well, right now there's simply no way of calculating the actual height and width of a cell via Apps Script, and therefore the height of a row and the width of a column. I've written my own code to approximate such calculations (with a ton of assumptions I wanna add) and the result is mediocre at best. The best results occur in cells without text wrapping (text will not move to a new line, even if it doesn't fit within the cell), assuming that all cell contents fit within them, as they get wild when larger sentences are added in the mix, with text wrapping being apparent. I've spent countless of hours trying to solve this issue, but honestly, you can only improve it, never totally resolving it. I've reached a point that, to my mind, it's  "*good enough*", and decided to move on, until we get better tools from Google. This will affect the position of some buttons, as they are supposed to always be in the middle of a cell (this would also get resolved if we could add scripts/functionality to buttons **INSIDE** cells, and not only **OVER** cells -  there are multiple users asking for this feature in Google's Issue Tracker for years now). This will also affect the height of any row and the width of any column that gets automatically calculated when updating a sheet. What you can manually do is select every cell within a sheet (press CTRL+A or âŒ˜+A twice) and then double left click between any column, forcing the sheet to update its column lengths. Similarly, you can do the same for row heights, but this is rarely needed. At the same time, feel free to reposition any button you deem unfit to be in its place.
