# Glorion: TTRPG Apps Script for Google Sheets

Welcome to **Glorion**, a versatile Apps Script project designed to enhance your Tabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG) experience using Google Sheets. Glorion provides both Dungeon Masters (DMs) and players with powerful tools for customization and interaction, with the goal of supporting various TTRPG systems. As of right now, the tool supports D&D 5e.

## Overview

Glorion allows for extensive customization and interaction within your TTRPG campaigns through two primary Google Sheets:

1. **Database Sheet**: Managed by the DM, this sheet serves as the central repository for all campaign data, including custom classes, races, backgrounds, abilities, items etc. It’s the source of truth for the campaign, with all linked Character Sheets drawing from this database.

2. **Character Sheet**: Used by players to generate and manage their characters. This sheet allows players to issue commands, perform dice rolls, undo actions, and level up their characters, all while drawing from the DM's Database.

## Key Features

### 1. **Mobile Functionality**
- **Responsive Design**: Glorion is optimized for use on mobile devices via the Google Sheets app, allowing players and DMs to manage their campaigns and characters on the go.

### 2. **Flexible Customization Options**
- **Database Sheet Customization**: Easily create and modify custom game elements by filling in the cells of your Database Sheet. This includes adding new rows and columns or updating existing entries. Make adjustments to your campaign content without needing to write any code. Just use the provided sheet structure.

- **Advanced Argument Customization**: For more detailed customization, use up to 50 arguments to refine abilities. Examples include `healing: true` or `attacks: 3`. These adjustments are made through the Apps Script editor (Extensions > Apps Script) but still require no coding skills. Detailed documentation for these customization options will be provided in the future.

- **Hooks and Custom Code**: For ultimate flexibility, Glorion supports 12 hooks and a `hookMemory` argument to embed custom code snippets throughout the ability process. While this requires some coding knowledge, example snippets will be available for ease of use. Comprehensive guides and examples will be provided to help with implementing custom code.

## Future Plans

- **Designs and Templates**: Share designs for custom classes, races, backgrounds, abilities, items etc., along with installation guides and links.
- **Expansion**: While the tool currently supports D&D 5e, the aim is to expand compatibility to other TTRPG systems.
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regular updates and new features will be added to enhance functionality and user experience.

## About the Project

Glorion is named after the world I’ve been building for over a decade. The tool reflects my design and world-building efforts, providing an example and inspiration for users to create their own content. Future updates will include more details about my world and design philosophy.
